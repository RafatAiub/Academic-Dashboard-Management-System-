  ├── POST   - Create with validation
  └── /[id]
      ├── GET    - Get single course
      ├── PUT    - Update course
      └── DELETE - Delete course
```

### **Frontend (Pages)**
```
/                  - Dashboard with stats
/students          - Student list with CRUD
/students/[id]     - Student detail/edit
/courses           - Course list with CRUD
/courses/[id]      - Course detail/edit
```

### **Components**
```

```

### **Types & Validation**
```
types/
├── student.ts - Student interface
└── course.ts  - Course interface

lib/
├── validators.ts - Zod schemas (studentSchema, courseSchema)
└── mock-db.ts    - In-memory database
```
